🎯 GOAL

Promote your website and continuously publish quizzes & puzzles to social media so that:
	•	People discover AmAha
	•	They play quizzes/puzzles
	•	They come back daily
	•	You build organic growth, not just ads

⸻

1️⃣ WHICH SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS TO FOCUS ON (DON’T DO ALL)

Since your content is:
	•	Kids quizzes
	•	Puzzles
	•	Simple learning
	•	Visual & interactive

✅ BEST PLATFORMS (in priority order)

🥇 Instagram (Reels + Posts)
	•	Best for kids learning visuals
	•	Parents spend time here
	•	Reels get organic reach

🥈 YouTube Shorts
	•	Very high discoverability
	•	Reusable content from Reels
	•	Long-term value

🥉 Facebook
	•	Parents groups
	•	School / kids learning communities

Optional (later):
	•	X (Twitter) → programming quizzes
	•	LinkedIn → developer quizzes (Java, coding)

👉 Do NOT start with all.
Start with Instagram + YouTube Shorts only.

⸻

2️⃣ CONTENT TYPES YOU SHOULD POST (VERY IMPORTANT)

You should NOT just say “Visit our website”.

You must post content-first, website-second.

⸻

🔥 A. Daily Quiz Post (MOST IMPORTANT)

Example:

Instagram Reel
	•	Slide 1: “🐶 Which animal makes this sound?”
	•	Slide 2: Dog image + Woof sound
	•	Slide 3: Options A/B/C
	•	Slide 4: Answer + CTA

Caption:
Can your child guess this animal? 🐶

🧩 B. Daily Puzzle Post

Example:
	•	“Match the fruit 🍎 to its color”
	•	Show half puzzle → pause → reveal answer

This builds curiosity + engagement.

⸻

🧠 C. Programming Quiz (Adults)

Example:
Java Quiz:
What is the output of this code?

A) 10
B) 20
C) Compile Error
D) Runtime Error
Perfect for:
	•	LinkedIn
	•	Twitter
	•	YouTube Shorts
    👨‍👩‍👧 D. Parent-Focused Posts (Trust Builder)

Example:
	•	“5 minutes of quiz a day improves memory”
	•	“Screen time that actually teaches”

These convert parents, not kids.

⸻

3️⃣ HOW TO PUBLISH REGULAR QUIZZES AUTOMATICALLY (SMART WAY)

You already have quizzes in your database.

💡 BEST STRATEGY:

👉 Generate social media content FROM your quiz data

⸻

🔁 FLOW (RECOMMENDED)
Quiz DB / Puzzle DB
      ↓
Social Content Generator (Script / Agent)
      ↓
Images + captions + hashtags
      ↓
Scheduled to Instagram / YouTube

🛠 HOW TO IMPLEMENT THIS (PRACTICAL)

Option A: Manual (Start now)
	•	Pick 1 quiz daily
	•	Create image using:
	•	Canva
	•	DALL·E / Midjourney
	•	Post manually

✅ Good for first 1–2 months

⸻

Option B: Semi-Automated (Best for you)

Ask an agent to create:
/admin/social-posts

	•	Pick quiz or puzzle
	•	Auto-generate:
	•	Question image
	•	Options image
	•	Answer image
	•	Copy-ready caption
	•	Download / share

You manually upload → but content creation is instant

⸻

Option C: Fully Automated (Later)
	•	Use Meta Graph API
	•	Use YouTube API
	•	Schedule posts daily

⚠️ Do this only after content quality is proven.

5️⃣ HOW TO DRIVE PEOPLE BACK TO YOUR WEBSITE

❌ Don’t say:

“Visit our website”

✅ Say:
	•	“Play 100+ quizzes free”
	•	“New puzzles added daily”
	•	“Can your kid score 10/10?”

Use curiosity + challenge, not marketing.

6️⃣ BEST HASHTAGS (STARTER)

7️⃣ METRICS TO TRACK (DON’T IGNORE THIS)

Track weekly:
	•	Profile visits
	•	Link clicks
	•	Website sessions
	•	Quiz attempts per day

If posts get views but no clicks → CTA problem
If clicks but no play → landing page problem
