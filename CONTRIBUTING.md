## 🧠 Core Principles

Before contributing, please understand these rules:

### 1. Small & Clean Files
- Each file should ideally be **≤ 100 lines**
- One responsibility per file
- Avoid god-components

### 2. Separation of Concerns
- UI → `/components` or `/ui`
- Logic → `/hooks`
- Data → `/services`
- Pages → `/pages` or feature folders

### 3. Predictable UX
- No surprise navigation
- No auto-redirects without guards
- User should always understand *why* something happened

---

## 🎯 Coding Standards

### React
- Functional components only
- Hooks for logic
- No inline business logic in UI components

### Naming
- `useSomething` → hooks
- `SomethingService.js` → Firestore / backend
- `SomethingPage.jsx` → pages

### Styling
- Prefer shared styles
- Avoid inline styles unless UI-specific
- Keep animations subtle and safe

## 🔥 Quiz Rules (DO NOT BREAK)

- Level completes **only if all answers are correct**
- Wrong answer → retry required
- No question repetition across levels
- Resume shown **only once**

---
